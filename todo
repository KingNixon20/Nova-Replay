UI Polish
Animations?
AppIcon

finish settings page quality(CRF vs bitrate)/performance of the encoder
-c:v libx264        # CPU H.264
-c:v h264_nvenc     # NVIDIA GPU
-c:v h264_vaapi     # VAAPI (Intel/AMD)
-c:v hevc_nvenc     # H.265 on NVIDIA

(speed vs quality)
CPU presets (libx264)
ultrafast → superfast → veryfast → faster → fast → medium → slow → slower → veryslow

Example:

-preset veryfast


Slower = better compression, more CPU.

NVIDIA NVENC presets
p1 (fastest) → p7 (best quality)


Example:

-preset p5
